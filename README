uMon - minimal host monitoring
==============================

If you prefer plaintext, please read static_assets/README.org
(org-mode, works best in Emacs).

If you prefer the rendered result, open static_assets/README.html in
your browser, or visit https://tomscii.sig7.se/umon where the latest
version is publicly hosted.

The same document is also served by any running uMon fastCGI server;
just click on the uMon logo in the navbar!
