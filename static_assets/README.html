<p>
<i>&mu;Mon</i> (ascii: <code>uMon</code>; pron.: <i>micro-mon</i>) is a minimal host
monitoring toolkit based on <a href="https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/">RRDtool</a> to store, aggregate and graph
time-series metrics data.  Metrics are collected via SNMP and simple
shell scripts.
</p>

<p>
For a popular introduction to <i>&mu;Mon</i>, please read <a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/2022/07/uMon-stupid-simple-monitoring">this article</a>,
which tells you the story of why it exists, compares it with existing
solutions, and exhibits some screenshots. For a more technical
overview and specific instructions, read the rest of this document.
</p>

<p>
<i>&mu;Mon</i> is currently usable under Linux (tested on Debian) and
OpenBSD, but should be portable to other Unix-like systems with
minimal hassle.

<p>
As opposed to more accomplished (and much more complex) monitoring
stacks, the overarching architectural principle of <i>&mu;Mon</i> is
<b>simplicity</b>. This results in some noteworthy properties:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>From <i>&mu;Mon</i>'s perspective, all hosts are self-contained. Each
probe gathers metrics directly observed on the local host. Data
collection does not inherently entail network traffic. There is no
single point of failure in the monitoring system; as long as a host
is up, its own metrics will be collected.</li>

<li>There is no central database to run queries against; each probe
feeds data into a local round-robin archive (an RRDtool database
file).  Data collection is scheduled by a trivial <code>crontab</code> entry.</li>

<li>As a consequence of self-containment, all hosts run their own
instance of the <i>&mu;Mon</i> fastCGI handler to serve the web UI. This
is a small C++ program that accepts input on its <i>stdin</i> and writes
to its <i>stdout</i> and <i>stderr</i>. This program does <i>not</i> contain any
networking code. Thus, it must be run via some kind of network
wrapper. Both <code>socat</code> and <code>(x)inetd</code> work well; the latter is
recommended for actual usage.</li>

<li>Because everything is local, and RRDtool does all the data series
aggregation, serving graphs and views is <i>fast</i>. It does not matter
if you are looking at the last hour or last year of data.</li>

<li>The fastCGI handler must be hooked into a webserver, which might run
on the same host or a different host. There are obvious implications
of these choices, none of which concern <i>&mu;Mon</i> itself. See below
for detailed setup and configuration guidance.</li>

<li>There is no alerting logic, only (scheduled) metrics collection and
(on-demand) graph generation. <i>&mu;Mon</i> is meant as a lightweight
solution to robust systems that need not be closely monitored.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The downside of this very simple architecture is the lack of a
"central instance" to upgrade: the <i>&mu;Mon</i> deployment will have to
be updated on all systems to roll out a change. Also, there is no
systemic way to collect and display metrics that span multiple hosts,
short of implementing a single probe on one of the hosts to collect
and aggregate the data in the desired way.

<p>
Some probes assume they are run as singletons &#x2013; e.g., it does not
make sense to have more than one instance of the <code>load</code> probe on any
system. Other probes must be parameterized for each instance. For
example, the <code>if</code> probe needs a separate instance for each interface
to be monitored (and the user must decide which interfaces to
monitor).
</p>

<p>
Configuring <i>what to monitor</i> is as simple as listing all probe
instances &#x2013; with any necessary parameters &#x2013; in the file
<code>probe.conf</code>. Here is a simple example:
</p>

<pre class="example">
# This is probe.conf - commented lines like this are discarded.
probe load
probe cpu
probe vmstat
probe df
probe diskio sda
probe if ens3
probe if lo
</pre>

<p>
Note that not all supported probes are present. This example is from a
host that does not run any mail software, so the <code>doveadm-who</code> and
<code>smtpd</code> probes have been omitted. There is no UPS either, so <code>upsc</code> is
missing as well.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-Graphs" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="Graphs">Graphs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Graphs">
<p>
Each defined probe instance produces and feeds one round-robin archive
file. This RRA will contain a set of data series (variables). Some
probes have a hardwired set of variables, such as <code>load</code> (moving
averages for 1, 5 and 15 minutes) or <code>if</code> (received and transmitted
bytes and packets on the given network interface). Other probes
determine the set of variables dynamically, for example <code>cpu</code>
(depending on the number of cores) or <code>df</code> (depending on the actual
file systems).
</p>

<p>
Graphs are loosely coupled to the probes. They are defined under
<code>graphs/</code> and use all or a subset of the data series maintained by a
given probe. The graph is named after the probe, suffixed with a
specialization if it only displays part of the captured data. For
example, the <code>cpu</code> graph script creates the CPU utilisation graph
(there is only one such graph on any system). On the other hand,
<code>diskio-ops</code> and <code>diskio-xfer</code> are two graphs based on <code>diskio</code> probe
data, available for each monitored network interface.
</p>

<p>
In theory, it would be possible to have graphs that display data from
multiple probes, but there is no such graph yet.
</p>

<p>
Graphs might look at the probe state (environment) to make use of
dynamically determined information that the probe has stored there,
such as the names of data series (e.g., in case of <code>df</code>, the actual
filesystem mount points). They also receive the time span (e.g., to
display the last 6 hours) as a command line argument, so they invoke
<code>rrdtool graph</code> with the correct parameter.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-Views" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="Views">Views</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Views">
<p>
The contents of <code>probes.conf</code> inform the view layout as well, by
getting filtered through the view scripts under <code>views/</code>. For example,
on the <code>main</code> view, each defined probe instance will generate <i>some</i>
graph, but (to reduce clutter) not necessarily all the graphs based on
the probe's data. More specialized views work the opposite way. For
example, the <code>upsc</code> view will generate <i>all</i> the graphs based on data
collected by the <code>upsc</code> probe, and no graphs for any of the other
probes.
</p>

<p>
Not all views might make sense for a given probe configuration. If
there is no <code>upsc</code> probe instance, the <code>upsc</code> view should not be
offered.  This is something left to be configured by the user. The
file <code>views.conf</code> should contain the names of views, one per
line. This would be a good fit for the probe config above:
</p>

<pre class="example">
# This is views.conf - commented lines like this are discarded.
main
io
disk
network
vmstat

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Extending%20%2F%5Cmu%7B%7DMon%2F">
<p>
Implementing new probes is fairly straightforward based on existing
ones &#x2013; it is best to clone one that has something in common with the
new probe to be added: SNMP vs. command-based query; fixed vs. dynamic
set of data series; etc.. The scripts reside under <code>probes/</code>.
</p>

<p>
Probes are permitted to have some persistent state (considered to be
the probe's <i>environment</i>), which is customarily saved beside the
probe script in an <code>.env</code> file. For example, the CPU usage probe
<code>cpu.sh</code> creates <code>cpu.env</code> on its first invocation to store the number
of cores so it does not have to be queried on every run. If a probe is
changed in an incompatible way, this <code>.env</code> file must be deleted
together with the RRA so the probe can start with a clear state.
</p>

<p>
Depending on the probe, its data will be displayed on one or more
graphs. Creating these graphs is mostly copy-paste based on existing
ones, with some trial and error to make the output graphs of <code>rrdtool</code>
look good.  The new graphs will have to be added to some existing
views (chiefly the <code>main</code> view), with possibly a bespoke (thematic)
view created to display all of them.
</p>

<p>
This sounds like more hassle than it actually is, but it is more or
less only cloning and light adaptation of some small shell scripts,
not a "serious" programming activity. As a plus, the fastCGI handler
(and its network wrapper, e.g. <code>xinetd</code>) does not have to be restarted
during development. Changes made to any of the shell scripts are
immediately effective (on the next sample for probes, and on the next
page load for graphs and views).

Since <i>&mu;Mon</i> is very hands-on and sooner or later you will want to
change something in its source scripts, it is probably best to clone
it from git onto some dev machine. This can be your personal laptop,
a dedicated test (staging) host, etc. On this machine, run <i>&mu;Mon</i>
directly from the git clone. This allows you to have direct feedback
on any changes you make and version-control those changes on a local
branch. When you want to deploy your flavour of <i>&mu;Mon</i> to
"production" (i.e., your other machines), execute <code>make dist</code> in the
top-level folder of this checkout. This will create <code>umon.tar.gz</code> that
is referenced by the below instructions.

<pre class="example">
# useradd -c "uMon" -d /var/umon -s /sbin/nologin -L daemon _umon
# mkdir /var/umon
# chown _umon:_umon /var/umon

<p>
Untar the umon archive to the home directory of this user:
</p>
<pre class="example">
# doas -u _umon /bin/sh -c "cd &amp;&amp; tar xzf /path/to/umon.tar.gz"

<p>
Install dependencies:
</p>
<pre class="example">
# pkg_add rrdtool socat

<p>
Note: <code>socat</code> is only needed for running the fcgi as a standalone
service; for production, usage of <code>inetd</code> (part of the base system,
hence no need to install it) is recommended.
</p>

<p>
Create a copy of <code>examples/*.conf</code> to the main <i>&mu;Mon</i> directory
(one level up). You do not necessarily need to make changes to all of
these files, but you are encouraged to look at them. If you decide to
make changes (now or later), having the upstream version under
<code>examples/</code> will protect you from overwriting your local config in
case you untar an updated archive on top of your <i>&mu;Mon</i> instance.

Configure and enable <code>snmpd</code>:
</p>
<pre class="example">
# cp /etc/examples/snmpd.conf /etc/
# echo "listen on 127.0.0.1 snmpv2c" &gt;&gt; /etc/snmpd.conf
# echo "read-only community public" &gt;&gt; /etc/snmpd.conf
# rcctl enable snmpd
# rcctl start snmpd
</pre>

<p>
Note: you are free (and encouraged) to use a different community string.
Please set <code>SNMP_COMMUNITY</code> in <code>umon.conf</code> accordingly if you do so.
</p>

<p>
Verify that snmp queries work, output should be something similar to below:
</p>
<pre class="example">
$ snmp walk -v 2c -c public localhost ifDescr
ifDescr.1 = STRING: em0
ifDescr.2 = STRING: enc0
ifDescr.3 = STRING: lo0
ifDescr.4 = STRING: pflog0
</pre>

<p>
By default, RRD databases will be created under <code>db/</code>, with
consolidation functions to yield appropriate granularity on view
durations ranging from the last 1 hour to the last 2 years. You can
change these by editing <code>umon.conf</code>, but everything should be fine as
is.
</p>

<p>
Configure the plugins by editing <code>probes.conf</code>. This should be
straightforward, but you might need to check your system to know what
the appropriate device names are.
</p>

<p>
Depending on which probes you have enabled, you might need some or all
of the below privilege escalations added to <code>/etc/doas.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre class="example">
# Permit _umon to run query commands
permit nopass _umon as root cmd doveadm args who
permit nopass _umon as root cmd smtpctl args show stats
</pre>

<p>
Now run <code>probes/sample.sh</code> manually and observe that it creates RRD
databases without errors:
</p>
<pre class="example">
$ probes/sample.sh
Creating directory for RRD files: db
...
Creating db/load.rrd
Creating db/df.rrd
Creating db/cpu.rrd
Creating db/vmstat.rrd
...
</pre>

<p>
Create a crontab entry for running <code>sample.sh</code> once every minute:
</p>

<pre class="example">
$ crontab -l
# min hr  dom mon dow command
*   *   *   *   *   /var/umon/probes/sample.sh 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;/dev/null

Configure <code>httpd</code> by adding this to <code>/etc/httpd.conf</code>:
</p>

<pre class="example">
# uMon - rrdtool-based monitoring
server "default" {
    listen on * port 8888
    location "/*" {
        fastcgi socket tcp 127.0.0.1 3333
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
Feel free to change the listen address/port appropriately,
e.g. <code>listen on 127.0.0.1</code> instead of <code>listen on *</code> if you do not wish
the <i>&mu;Mon</i> webpage to be accessible from the network. In such
case, you can still access it by setting up an ssh tunnel. Or set up
http basic auth so only people who know the credentials have access to
it. Etc.
</p>

<p>
Make sure your changes take effect:
</p>
<pre class="example">
# rcctl reload httpd
</pre>


<p>
Compile the fastCGI server:
</p>
<pre class="example">
make -C fcgi
</pre>


<p>
This creates the <code>fcgi/umon_fcgi</code> binary executable from its C++ sources.
</p>

<p>
If you want to develop the fastCGI server program of <i>&mu;Mon</i>, it is
convenient to run the server standalone so you can see the <i>stdout</i> in
the console. You can do that by executing the wrapper script
<code>fcgi/standalone.sh</code>. This requires <code>socat</code> to be installed. Note: to
develop or change probes, graphs or views, you do not need to touch
the fastCGI server, as it only invokes the corresponding shell scripts
and is itself quite generic. Hence, you most probably want to deploy
as "normal".
</p>

<p>
For normal deployment, you will want to set up <code>inetd</code> to invoke the
fastCGI server via the <code>fcgi/inetd.sh</code> wrapper. This is convenient for
development of graphs and views as well, in the sense that nothing has
to be restarted after rebuilding the <code>umon_fcgi</code> executable; however,
<i>stderr</i> will go to <code>/dev/null</code>.  Use a config similar to this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
# cat /etc/inetd.conf
127.0.0.1:3333  stream  tcp     nowait  _umon     /var/umon/fcgi/inetd.sh
</pre>

<p>
Make sure you enable and start <code>inetd</code> as appropriate:
</p>
<pre class="example">
# rcctl enable inetd
# rcctl start inetd
</pre>



<p>
Configure the views you want to access by editing <code>views.conf</code>.
</p>

<p>
Navigate your browser to <a href="http://your.hostname:8888">http://your.hostname:8888</a>. The main view
should load. (Tip: you can read this document by clicking on the
<i>&mu;Mon</i> logo in the navbar!)

If you have a new, updated source archive <code>umon.tar.gz</code>, you can
safely untar it on top of your existing installation:
</p>

<pre class="example">
doas -u _umon /bin/sh -c "cd &amp;&amp; tar xzf /path/to/umon.tar.gz &amp;&amp; make -C fcgi"
</pre>


<p>
Your actual config files will not be overwritten. If there were
changes made to the example config files, you might want to migrate
some or all of those to your actual config (<code>*.conf</code> in the main
<i>&mu;Mon</i> directory).
</p>

<p>
If there is a change to the RRD format (data series names) produced by
a probe, reinitialize it by deleting the corresponding RRD file(s)
under <code>db/</code> and any probe state files <code>probes/*.env</code> produced by the
probe (the base name should match the probe).

useradd -s /usr/sbin/nologin -r -M -d /var/umon _umon
mkdir /var/umon
chown _umon:_umon /var/umon
</pre>

<p>
Untar the umon archive to the home directory of this user:
</p>
<pre class="example">
# sudo -u _umon /bin/sh -c "cd &amp;&amp; tar xzf /path/to/umon.tar.gz"
</pre>


<p>
Install dependencies:
</p>
<pre class="example">
# apt-get install rrdtool socat
</pre>


<p>
Note: <code>socat</code> is only needed for running the fcgi as a standalone
service; for production, usage of <code>xinetd</code> is recommended.
</p>

<p>
Create a copy of <code>examples/*.conf</code> to the main <i>&mu;Mon</i> directory
(one level up). You do not necessarily need to make changes to all of
these files, but you are encouraged to look at them. If you decide to
make changes (now or later), having the upstream version under
<code>examples/</code> will protect you from overwriting your local config in
case you untar an updated archive on top of your <i>&mu;Mon</i> instance.

Install and configure Net-SNMP:
</p>

<pre class="example">
# apt-get install snmp snmpd snmp-mibs-downloader
</pre>


<p>
Edit <code>/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf</code> and open up access to OIDs by adding a line such as:
</p>

<pre class="example">
view   systemonly  included   .1.3.6
</pre>


<p>
Restart <code>snmpd</code> for the changes to take effect:
</p>
<pre class="example">
# systemctl restart snmpd
</pre>


<p>
Note: you are free (and encouraged) to use a different community string.
Please set <code>SNMP_COMMUNITY</code> in <code>umon.conf</code> accordingly if you do so.
</p>

<p>
Verify that snmp queries work, output should be something similar to below:
</p>
<pre class="example">
$ snmpwalk -O n -v 2c -c public localhost .1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.1.1 = STRING: "lo"
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.1.2 = STRING: "ens3"
</pre>

<p>
By default, RRD databases will be created under <code>db/</code>, with
consolidation functions to yield appropriate granularity on view
durations ranging from the last 1 hour to the last 2 years. You can
change these by editing <code>umon.conf</code>, but everything should be fine as
is.
</p>

<p>
Configure the plugins by editing <code>probes.conf</code>. This should be
straightforward, but you might need to check your system to know what
the appropriate device names are.
</p>

<p>
Depending on which probes you have enabled, you might need to delegate
the privilege of running certain commands (as root) to the <code>_umon</code>
user. On a stock Linux using <code>sudo</code>, just create <code>/etc/sudoers.d/umon</code>
with some or all of the below lines:
</p>

<pre class="example">
# Permit _umon to run query commands
_umon   ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/doveadm
_umon   ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/smtpctl
</pre>

<p>
Now run <code>probes/sample.sh</code> manually and observe that it creates RRD
databases without errors:
</p>
<pre class="example">
# sudo -u _umon /bin/bash
$ cd
$ probes/sample.sh
Creating directory for RRD files: db
...
Creating db/load.rrd
Creating db/df.rrd
Creating db/cpu.rrd
Creating db/vmstat.rrd
...
</pre>

<p>
Create a crontab entry for running <code>sample.sh</code> once every minute:
</p>

<pre class="example">
$ crontab -l
# min hr  dom mon dow command
*   *   *   *   *   /var/umon/probes/sample.sh 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;/dev/null
</pre>


<p>
If you are collecting or tailing syslog messages as a matter of
course, you might be annoyed by the nonsensical verbosity of cronjob
logging, emitting not one but <i>three</i> entries per minute. To stop
these useless entries from flooding your logs, create
<code>/etc/rsyslog.d/umon_block.conf</code> with the below content:
</p>

<pre class="example">
if $msg contains "pam_unix(cron:session)" or $msg contains "_umon"
then {
    stop
}
</pre>

<p>
Do not forget to restart the syslog daemon for this to take effect.
</p>

The below configuration example applies to <code>nginx</code> on the local host.
If you use a different webserver or want to access the fastCGI socket
from a different host, please adapt your config accordingly.
</p>

<p>
Merge this snippet into your enabled virtual hosts configs:
</p>

<pre class="example">
server {
    fastcgi_param  CONTENT_LENGTH     $content_length;
    fastcgi_param  CONTENT_TYPE       $content_type;
    fastcgi_param  DOCUMENT_URI       $document_uri;
    fastcgi_param  QUERY_STRING       $query_string;
    fastcgi_param  REQUEST_METHOD     $request_method;
    fastcgi_param  REQUEST_URI        $request_uri;

    listen 8888;
    location / {
        fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:3333;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
(If you do not have any webserver installed, just <code>apt-get install
nginx</code> and add the above snippet to <code>/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default</code>.)
</p>

<p>
Make sure your changes take effect:
</p>
<pre class="example">
systemctl reload nginx
</pre>


<p>
Compile the fastCGI server:
</p>
<pre class="example">
make -C fcgi
</pre>


<p>
Please see above in the equivalent OpenBSD section for a discussion
on running the fastCGI server for development purposes.
</p>

<p>
For normal deployment, you will want to set up <code>xinetd</code> to invoke the
fastCGI server via the <code>fcgi/inetd.sh</code> wrapper. This is convenient for
development of graphs and views as well, in the sense that nothing has
to be restarted after rebuilding the <code>umon_fcgi</code> executable; however,
<i>stderr</i> will go to <code>/dev/null</code>.
</p>

<p>
If you do not yet have it installed, <code>apt-get install xinetd</code>.
Then, create a file <code>/etc/xinetd.d/umon_fcgi</code> with the below content:
</p>

<pre class="example">
service umon_fcgi
{
        disable         = no
        type            = UNLISTED
        socket_type     = stream
        protocol        = tcp
        interface       = 127.0.0.1
        port            = 3333
        user            = _umon
        wait            = no
        server          = /var/umon/fcgi/inetd.sh
}
</pre>

<p>
Don't forget to enable/start <code>xinetd</code> as appropriate:
</p>
<pre class="example">
# systemctl enable xinetd
# systemctl start xinetd
</pre>


<p>
Configure the views you want to access by editing <code>views.conf</code>.
</p>

<p>
Navigate your browser to <a href="http://your-hostname:8888">http://your-hostname:8888</a>. The main view
should load. (Tip: you can read this document by clicking on the
<i>&mu;Mon</i> logo in the navbar!)
