/\mu{}Mon/ (ascii: =uMon=; pron.: "mu-mon") is a minimal host
monitoring toolkit based on [[https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/][RRDtool]] to store, aggregate and graph
time-series metrics data.  Metrics are collected via SNMP and simple
shell scripts.

For a general introduction to /\mu{}Mon/, please read [[https://tomscii.sig7.se/2022/04/uMon-stupid-simple-monitoring][this article]],
which tells you the story of why it exists, compares it with existing
solutions, and exhibits some screenshots. For a more technical
overview and specific instructions, read the rest of this document.

/\mu{}Mon/ is currently usable under Linux (tested on Debian) and
OpenBSD, but should be portable to other Unix-like systems with
minimal hassle.

/\mu{}Mon/ is published under a very permissive BSD license (the same
flavour that OpenBSD uses).

#+TOC: headlines 3

* Installation and getting started

Since /\mu{}Mon/ is very hands-on and sooner or later you will want to
change something in its source scripts, it is probably best to clone
it from git on to some dev machine. This can be your personal laptop,
a dedicated test (staging) host, etc. On this machine, run /\mu{}Mon/
directly from the git clone. This allows you to have direct feedback
on any changes you make and version-control those changes on a local
branch. When you want to deploy your flavour of /\mu{}Mon/ to
"production" (i.e., your other machines), execute =make dist= in the
top-level folder of this checkout. This will create =umon.tar.gz= that
is referenced by the below instructions.

** OpenBSD

*** Initial deployment

Create a dedicated unprivileged user:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# useradd -c "uMon" -d /var/umon -s /sbin/nologin -L daemon _umon
# mkdir /var/umon
# chown _umon:_umon /var/umon
#+END_EXAMPLE

Untar the umon archive to the home directory of this user:
: # doas -u _umon /bin/sh -c "cd && tar xzf /path/to/umon.tar.gz"

Install dependencies:
: # pkg_add rrdtool socat

Note: =socat= is only needed for running the fcgi as a standalone
service; for production, usage of =inetd= is recommended.

*** Setting up metrics collection

Configure and enable =snmpd=:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# cp /etc/examples/snmpd.conf /etc/
# echo "listen on 127.0.0.1 snmpv2c" >> /etc/snmpd.conf
# echo "read-only community public" >> /etc/snmpd.conf
# rcctl enable snmpd
# rcctl start snmpd
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note: you are free (and encouraged) to use a different community string.
Please set =SNMP_COMMUNITY= in =umon.conf= accordingly if you do so.

Verify that snmp queries work, output should be something similar to below:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ snmp walk -v 2c -c public localhost ifDescr
ifDescr.1 = STRING: em0
ifDescr.2 = STRING: enc0
ifDescr.3 = STRING: lo0
ifDescr.4 = STRING: pflog0
#+END_EXAMPLE

By default, RRD databases will be created under =db/=, with
consolidation functions to yield appropriate granularity on view
durations ranging from the last 1 hour to the last 2 years. You can
change these by editing =umon.conf=, but everything should be fine as
is.

Configure the plugins by copying =probes.conf.example= to =probes.conf=
and editing it. This should be straightforward, but you might need to
check your system to know what the appropriate device names are.

Depending on which probes you have enabled, you might need some or all
of the below privilege escalations added to =/etc/doas.conf=:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# Permit _umon to run query commands
permit nopass _umon as root cmd doveadm args who
permit nopass _umon as root cmd smtpctl args show stats
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now run =probes/sample.sh= manually and observe that it creates RRD
databases without errors:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ probes/sample.sh
Creating directory for RRD files: db
...
Creating db/load.rrd
Creating db/df.rrd
Creating db/cpu.rrd
Creating db/vmstat.rrd
...
#+END_EXAMPLE

Create a crontab entry for running =sample.sh= once every minute:

: $ crontab -l
: # min hr  dom mon dow command
: *   *   *   *   *   /var/umon/probes/sample.sh 2>&1 >/dev/null

*** Setting up the web view

Configure =httpd= by adding this to =/etc/httpd.conf=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# uMon - rrdtool-based monitoring
server "default" {
    listen on * port 8888
    location "/*" {
        fastcgi socket tcp 127.0.0.1 3333
    }
}
#+END_EXAMPLE

Feel free to change the listen address/port appropriately,
e.g. =listen on 127.0.0.1= instead of =listen on *= if you do not wish
the /\mu{}Mon/ webpage to be accessible from the network. In such
case, you can still access it by setting up an ssh tunnel. Or set up
http basic auth so only people who know the credentials have access to
it. Etc.

Make sure your changes take effect:
: # rcctl reload httpd

Compile the fastcgi server:
: make -C fcgi

This creates the =fcgi/umon_fcgi= binary executable from its C++ sources.

If you want to develop the fastcgi server program of /\mu{}Mon/, it is
convenient to run the server standalone so you can see the stdout in
the console. You can do that by executing the wrapper script
=fcgi/standalone.sh=. This requires =socat= to be installed. Note: to
develop or change probes, graphs or views, you do not need to touch
the fastcgi server, as it only invokes the corresponding shell scripts
and is itself quite generic. Hence, you most probably want to deploy
as "normal".

For normal deployment, you will want to set up =inetd= to invoke the
fastcgi server via the =fcgi/inetd.sh= wrapper. This is convenient for
development of graphs and views as well, in the sense that nothing has
to be restarted after rebuilding the =umon_fcgi= executable; however,
stderr will go to /dev/null.  Use a config similar to this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# cat /etc/inetd.conf
127.0.0.1:3333  stream  tcp     nowait  _umon     /var/umon/fcgi/inetd.sh
#+END_EXAMPLE

Make sure you enable and start =inetd= as appropriate:
: # rcctl enable inetd
: # rcctl start inetd


Configure the views you want to access by copying =view.conf.example= to
=view.conf= and editing it as appropriate.

Navigate your browser to http://your.hostname:8888. The main view
should load. (Tip: you can read this document by clicking on the
/\mu{}Mon/ logo in the navbar!)

*** Updating the deployment

If you have a new, updated source archive =umon.tar.gz=, you can
safely untar it on top of your existing installation:

: doas -u _umon /bin/sh -c "cd && tar xzf /path/to/umon.tar.gz"

Your actual config files will not be overwritten. If there were
changes made to the example config files, you might want to migrate
some or all of those to your actual config (=probes.conf=,
=view.conf=).

If there is a change to the RRD format (data series names) produced by
a probe, reinitialize it by deleting the corresponding RRD file(s)
under =db/= and any probe state files =probes/*.env= produced by the
probe (the base name should match the probe).

** Linux

*** Initial deployment

Create a dedicated unprivileged user:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
useradd -s /usr/sbin/nologin -r -M -d /var/umon _umon
mkdir /var/umon
chown _umon:_umon /var/umon
#+END_EXAMPLE

Untar the umon archive to the home directory of this user:
: # sudo -u _umon /bin/sh -c "cd && tar xzf /path/to/umon.tar.gz"

Install dependencies:
: # apt-get install rrdtool socat

Note: =socat= is only needed for running the fcgi as a standalone
service; for production, usage of =inetd= is recommended.

*** Setting up metrics collection

Install and configure Net-SNMP:

: # apt-get install snmp snmpd snmp-mibs-downloader

Edit =/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf= and open up access to OIDs by adding a line such as:

:  view   systemonly  included   .1.3.6

Restart =snmpd= for the changes to take effect:
: # systemctl restart snmpd

Note: you are free (and encouraged) to use a different community string.
Please set =SNMP_COMMUNITY= in =umon.conf= accordingly if you do so.

Verify that snmp queries work, output should be something similar to below:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ snmpwalk -O n -v 2c -c public localhost .1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.1.1 = STRING: "lo"
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.1.2 = STRING: "ens3"
#+END_EXAMPLE

Create (by copying from the examples) and edit the config files of
/\mu{}Mon/ as described in the OpenBSD section above.

Depending on which probes you have enabled, you might need to delegate
the privilege of running certain commands (as root) to the =_umon=
user. On a stock Linux using =sudo=, just create =/etc/sudoers.d/umon=
with some or all of the below lines:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# Permit _umon to run query commands
_umon   ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/doveadm
_umon   ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/smtpctl
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now run =probes/sample.sh= manually and observe that it creates RRD
databases without errors:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# sudo -u _umon /bin/bash
$ cd
$ probes/sample.sh
Creating directory for RRD files: db
...
Creating db/load.rrd
Creating db/df.rrd
Creating db/cpu.rrd
Creating db/vmstat.rrd
...
#+END_EXAMPLE

Create a crontab entry for running =sample.sh= once every minute:

: $ crontab -l
: # min hr  dom mon dow command
: *   *   *   *   *   /var/umon/probes/sample.sh 2>&1 >/dev/null

If you are collecting or tailing syslog messages as a matter of
course, you might be annoyed by the nonsensical verbosity of cronjob
logging, emitting not one but /three/ entries per minute. To stop
these useless entries from flooding your logs, create
=/etc/rsyslog.d/umon_block.conf= with the below content:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
if $msg contains "pam_unix(cron:session)" or $msg contains "_umon"
then {
    stop
}
#+END_EXAMPLE

Do not forget to restart the syslog daemon for this to take effect.

*** Setting up the web view

The below configuration example applies to =nginx= on the local host.
If you use a different webserver or want to access the fastcgi socket
from a different host, please adapt your config accordingly.

Merge this snippet into your enabled virtual hosts configs:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
server {
    fastcgi_param  CONTENT_LENGTH     $content_length;
    fastcgi_param  CONTENT_TYPE       $content_type;
    fastcgi_param  DOCUMENT_URI       $document_uri;
    fastcgi_param  QUERY_STRING       $query_string;
    fastcgi_param  REQUEST_METHOD     $request_method;
    fastcgi_param  REQUEST_URI        $request_uri;

    listen 8888;
    location / {
        fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:3333;
    }
}
#+END_EXAMPLE

(If you do not have any webserver installed, just =apt-get install
nginx= and add the above snippet to
=/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default=.

Make sure your changes take effect:
: systemctl reload nginx

Compile the fastcgi server:
: make -C fcgi

Please see above in the equivalent OpenBSD section for a discussion
on running the fastcgi server for development purposes.

For normal deployment, you will want to set up =xinetd= to invoke the
fastcgi server via the =fcgi/inetd.sh= wrapper. This is convenient for
development of graphs and views as well, in the sense that nothing has
to be restarted after rebuilding the =umon_fcgi= executable; however,
stderr will go to /dev/null.

If you do not yet have it installed, =apt-get install xinetd=.
Then, create a file =/etc/xinetd.d/umon_fcgi= with the below content:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
service umon_fcgi
{
        disable         = no
        type            = UNLISTED
        socket_type     = stream
        protocol        = tcp
        interface       = 127.0.0.1
        port            = 3333
        user            = _umon
        wait            = no
        server          = /var/umon/fcgi/inetd.sh
}
#+END_EXAMPLE

Don't forget to enable/start =xinetd= as appropriate:
: # systemctl enable xinetd
: # systemctl start xinetd

Configure the views you want to access by copying =view.conf.example= to
=view.conf= and editing it as appropriate.

Navigate your browser to http://your.hostname:8888. The main view
should load. (Tip: you can read this document by clicking on the
/\mu{}Mon/ logo in the navbar!)

*** Updating the deployment

The same considerations apply as with OpenBSD (see above).

The equivalent update command to use:

: sudo -u _umon /bin/sh -c "cd && tar xzf /path/to/umon.tar.gz"
